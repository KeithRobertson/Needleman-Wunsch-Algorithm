Algorithm for Global Sequence Alignment on strands of DNA

Using java swing to create a GUI for the described algorithm.


Done: the algorithm to calculate scores works correctly given 		an (nxn) matrix. So if both inputs are the same 			length.

To be done: Fix it so it correctly displays for (nxm) also.
		Highlight the path providing the highest alignment
